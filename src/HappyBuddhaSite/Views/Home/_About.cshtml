				<h2>What is Happy Buddha?</h2>
				<p class="lead">
					Agile teams are flexible and move at high speed when the ones that work actively improve themselves and their processses move quickly.

					Happy Buddha is here to help them improve, by supporting them in their sprint reviews, and giving employees real-time insight into
					how they are doing and how their teams, tribes and peers feel about the work being done and the direction of their efforts.
